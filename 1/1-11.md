1. Q: How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
   likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
2. A:
    - I already tested one input: more than one space, which the program handles
      beautifully.
    - Most tests need to be concerned with edge cases, not the most common
      input. Therefore you throw special characters at it, like backspaces and
      whitespace in various combinations. One place it fails is on DOS-based
      platforms. Or rather MAC OS, since, while Windows uses `\r\n` for newlines
      (which would pass), MAC OS uses `\r` alone (as far as I remember), which
      would not be tested for in the current program. Adding an extra or
      condition to test for `\r` would solve that.
